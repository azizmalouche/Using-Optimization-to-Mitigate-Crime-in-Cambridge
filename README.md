# Using Optimization to Mitigate Crime in Cambridge
Used deterministic and adaptive stochastic optimization to determine the optimal locations for 3 police stations in Cambridge and the optimal allocation of 281 officers to minimize late crime responses in 2024. Analyzed over 30,000 reported crimes from 2022 to 2023, mapping them using the Google Maps API. Excluded 2020-2021 data, as pandemic-related crime patterns skewed modern trends. Built and solved models in Julia and Gurobi, comparing multiple station placement strategies. The optimized solution resulted in 2.5× fewer late crimes compared to k-means clustering placement of police stations and 3.5× fewer compared to placing police stations at the three highest-crime nodes.
